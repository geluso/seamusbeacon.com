          Seamus passed away Saturday January 7th around 6PM. He was 14 years
          old and led a good life. He made so many friends in the neighborhood.
          Thank you to everyone who ever stopped to say hello to the guy. He is
          prepared for his next journey with snacks of pringles and butter at
          his side. The other animals in the house had a chance to say goodbye
          and gain an understanding that unfortunately Seamus is gone and not
          missing, though we do miss him very much.
        </p>

          Seamus is an old skinny friendly outdoor cat that lives in Beacon Hill.
          He roams generally in a quarter mile radius centered on the staircase on
          Holgate between 16th and 17th. Lots of people call about him concerned
          he is lost, underfed, sick or hungover. Generally he's not any of these things.
          If you give him pets and don't lock him inside your house he will find his way home.
        </p>

        <p>
          Seamus loooves to eat. I've never seen a cat eat as much as him. He loves to eat human
          food. I can't cook a meal without him checking my cooking. Don't let his appetite and
          his skinny physique fool you into thinking he's starving. His collar says "don't feed me"
          so you won't feel obliged to feed "the poor soul" and so he doesn't develop a pattern
          of visiting somewhere else for food other than his own home.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please enjoy Seamus' presence and give him lots of pets (and heck you
          can feed him some snacks, I know you're going to anyway). Take some pictures of
          him and text it to the number on his collar and I'll add your photos to the
          gallery.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thanks for caring about Seamus and have a wonderful day.

          The picture of "Seamus" walking on the patio fence against the blue
          sky is actually Seamus' housemate Morty but we love Morty too so he's shown here.
